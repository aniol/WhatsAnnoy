Tired of listening WhatsApp sound on other people's phones? With WhatsAnnoy you can play this sound yourself wherever you need to confuse your friends. Make them check their phones repeatedly with nothing to check actually. You can play the sound by touching a button or by scheduling them on time. There's even a random option!

Enjoy with responsibility.
